## Teaching 

I have been a private teacher in Mathematics for around 6 years and Computer Science for around 3 years. 
It has always been an opportunity for me to focus intensely on precise topics, often improving my own understanding of the subject.

During my gap year 2022/2023, I also taught computer science introductions in high school. This experience was different, 
I could reach and help more pupils but ended up having a lesser impact.

This trade-off between impact and audience is crucial, and with this blog, I'll be trying to maximise the effect while moving to a greater audience I've never had.

## Research Interests

I have a broad interest in AI research regarding the technology component (NLP, CV, RL). 
Yet, I am trying to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of these technologies.

Regarding AI in general, I am primarily concerned with misuse. This problem is at the heart of many other technologies, and we should always keep it in mind while devising new products. 
Then, like many others, I also noticed a considerable gap between the development speed of capabilities compared to safety. What's even more concerning is that this gap tends to widen. I outlined this in the story [My Approach to AI Safety](/stories/my-approach-to-ai-safety), and I might add another post on the subject detailing my agenda, theory of change, theory of impact and more.
