## Teaching 

I have been a private teacher in Mathematics, for around 6 years, and Computer Science, for around 3 years. 
It has always been the occasion for me to focus deeply on precise topics, often improving my own comprehension of the subject.

During my gap year 2022/2023, I also taught Computer Science Introduction in high school. This experience was different, 
I could reached and helped more pupils but ended up having a lesser impact.

This trade-off between impact and audience is crucial, and with this blog I'll be trying to maximise the impact while moving to a greater audience I've ever had.

## Research Interests

I have a broad interest in AI research regarding the technology component (NLP, CV, RL). 
Yet I am trying to focus first and foremost on the safety of these technology. 

My primary concern regarding AI lies in misuse. More in a forthcoming stories (My approach to AI Safety) detailling my agenda, theory of change and more.
