title: Creating a Startup
tldr: Creating a startup is not always about having the best or a totally new idea. Entrepreneurship is just another way to deliver value and achieve your goals and it's within everyone's reach. We chose this path because it is flexible, stimulating, deeply empowering, but also fun.

## The Creation Process

### Ideation

Ideation is not fixed in time it’s a long-lasting process that demands to iterate. It’s about refining some initial ideas with the first test and developments as well as with the first customer feedback.

- "Why now?":  
- "Why us?": Our “right” to solve the future problem of this precise market.

### The Team

The team presentation has two primary motives. First it is important for potential investor or client to get to know the team they'll be working with, but it is also crucial to present our edge and answer the question "Why us?".

> [!note] Edge
> 
> Each individual has a specific edge which is the combination of all his experiences and knowledge. There are three edges to consider in startup. The market edge, the technology edge and the catalyzed edge. 

**Alexandre the CEO:** Market edge. With his experience in web3…

**Florian the COO/CFO:** Catalyser edge. With his diverse set of lead experiences…

**Yoann the CTO:** Technology edge. With his participation in scientific research…

### The Official Creation

The legal process is not the funniest part but it is surely the most important.

Once everyone has agreed on the repartition.

Our startup has now officially 6 months.

## The Pitch

### Why BlockLoads?

Blockloads is there to transmit the idea of code modularity and components integration.

### The RoadMap

The roadmap has changed a lot but this is expected since we work in an agile way.

> Our ultimate goal always has been and always will be remain to facilitate and accelerate small shop keepers in their market adventure. 

This is likely to change along the road with the first dead-ends and customer feedback.
