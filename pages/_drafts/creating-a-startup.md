title: Creating a Startup
tldr: Creating a startup is not always about having the best or a totally new idea. Entrepreneurship is just another way to deliver value and achieve your goals and it's within everyone's reach. We chose this path because it is flexible, stimulating, deeply empowering, but also fun.

## The Creation Process

### Ideation

Ideation is not fixed in time it’s a long-lasting process that demands to iterate. It’s about refining some initial ideas with the first test and developments as well as with the first customer feedback. Yet it is always good to keep in mind some guiding drivers.

- "What and why?": Represents what you are trying to solve, and why it matters. There is a difference between nice-to-haves, must-haves and hair-on-fire issues which often leads to forgotten failures.
- "Why now?": Is important with regard to market dynamics and technology advancement. Maybe new opportunities are opening or a new technology could solve previously too complex problems.
- "Why you?": The “right” to solve the outlined problems of this precise market at this precise time. It's important to be able to justify your legitimacy which involves to understand your edges, more in the [team section](#the-team).

In the next sections I present the team forming process followed by the official creation and lastly by the pitch. I think that for us, and in general, the idea should come afterwards and can be shallow, drafty and blurred at the beginning. What feels the most important is the will to make things happen and the fulmination to innovate always feeling that you are the perfect team.

### The Team

The team presentation has two primary motives. First it is important for potential investor or client to get to know the team they'll be working with, but it is also crucial to present our edge and answer the question "Why us?".

> [!note] Edge [@1](#resources)
> 
> Each individual has a specific edge which is the combination of all his experiences and knowledge. There are three edges to consider in startup. The market edge, the technology edge and the catalyzer edge. The later being the diverse experiences and soft skills relevant the given startup.

The key points for a startup is the diversification, adaptability and agility of their founders and their processes. At the beginning it's important to have quick feedback loops first in the team and then with what you're building. Each founder has to take the lead on various subjects and they shall not fear to learn beyond their edge.

In term of the founding team size three seems the most convenient. For two people it's faster to discuss and to brainstorm ideas, yet the workloads might be to heavy at the beginnings. Four people is a lot of discussion channels/energy and with regards cohesion it might be hard to keep everyone at the same level of commitment. At three its still possible to communicate smoothly, the tasks can be divided and when one person is unavailable two are still on duty. And last but not least it's easy to break ties!

So here are the three champions:

**Alexandre the CEO:** Market edge. He graduated with a Master in marketing, management and business. He has expertise in web agency building websites with Shopify but also with other software like Webflow. What's more he has plenty of precious entrepreneurial skills as he also runs another startup in parallel and he's always listening to market waves.

**Florian the COO/CFO:** Catalyser edge. With his engineering diploma in logistics he has a broad background ranging from processes optimisation, organisation to software and coding skills. He has diverse set of lead experiences from projects as well as consulting that logically put him in charge of our processes. His engineering backgroung enable him to understand and link the technological solutions to the market needs.

**I, Yoann the CTO:** Technology edge. With my research degree and background I have a broad knowledge of cutting-edge AI technology. Yet I also practiced ML engineering during my apprenticeship where I had projects linked to model training, MLOps, DevOps and cloud deployment. I am running and architecturing the backend logic of our solutions as well as the AI integration.

I always feel that my cofounders are just amazing for the job they do and the efforts they put. If you don't feel the same maybe you should take a step back to assess your team edge deeper or speak up. Team cohesion is cornerstone of the startup especially in its early stages. Don't forget to fail fast!

### The Official Creation

The legal process is not the funniest part but it is surely the most important as it defines practically how the startup will run. This phase should come after a trial period where the team has beginning to build a POC.

> [!danger] Gotcha
> 
> The share reparation is the core issue when building an company and it should be thoughtfully discussed. It is the moment for everyone to shed light on his strength and acknowledged others'. Above all the final decision should be unanimous.

Once everyone has agreed on the repartition.

Our startup has now officially 6 months.. It is fairly important to be quick and efficient regarding legal, finance and administration. In the beginning there is no time to lose time on such matter and if the startup works its foundations cannot be shaky. Therefore don't hesitate to invest some money in these processes to delegate the dull and boring tasks to focus on what matters and where you can add value.

## The Pitch

### Why [BlockLoads](https://blockloads.com)?

Blockloads is there to transmit the idea of code modularity and components integration.

### The RoadMap

The roadmap has changed a lot but this is expected since we work in agile mode.

> [!success] Goal
> 
> Our ultimate goal always has been and always will be to facilitate and accelerate the shop development and administration. We want to be accessible for the modest shop keepers empowering them in their market adventure. 

This is likely to change along the road with the first dead-ends and customer feedback. 

### Meet Us

In order to get close to our customers and partners we decided to create a Discord server [BlockLoading](https://discord.gg/gf2j9P4JEa). We chose Discord as it is the perfect match for community building but also because we are already using it to run our startup.

> [!caution] Disclaimer
> 
> This server is under development regarding its architectures, bots, automation and purpose. While we are committed to grow a community this server might just be for customer service in the end.

We envision this media and cyber-space as a way to deliver fast and tailored customer service. We planned on hosting conferences, discussion groups and obviously QnA about our solutions but also about the Shopify ecosystem.
