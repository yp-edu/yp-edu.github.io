## The target
Before answering the “why?” let's discuss the “whom for?”.

As a former teacher in both private tutoring and high school, I felt the need for an audience to share my knowledge, thoughts and understandings. Yet the best audience you could dream of lies here, on the web. And so, two years ago (during my first AI research internship), I thought of starting a podcast or a blog about AI subjects.

I never took the fall since I've never felt legitimate enough to talk about the recent technological advancements (which this blog will be about). It was not quite an impostor syndrome but rather the feeling I hadn't collected the proper badge yet.

It is only recently that I overcame this desperate seek for approval and validation. I did collect some badges along the way, but I think there is no such thing as the “proper badge”. I, therefore, decided to write only for myself, considering any subject that would pique my curiosity.

## The goal

The blog is for me, right, but what do I need it for? I sometimes need to clarify my thoughts; then, writing is the way to go. I love to learn and discover new subjects, so why not report and popularise what I learnt to make sure I learnt them well? I often tend to procrastinate in my projects, so “forcing” me with a timeline might reduce latency.

So why not just keep my writing in Notion (where I craft ideas from mind to words)? Well, obviously, making it public increases my personal expectations of the realisation and its frequency.

Should any of my future post help at least one person, I would consider the goal of this blog achieved. Since the more, the better; I opened some contact channels to make it as helpful as possible.

## The shape

### Stories

### Projects

### Popularisation

A place to share my understanding of recent articles, technology or even philosophical ideas.

## A right to be wrong

I think even if I am writing public content, I have a right to be wrong. I have a duty to cite the previous and inspirational work. I have incentives to make the content as sharp and as accurate as possible. Yet mistakes happen!
